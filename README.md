This is the Readme for the 'Interlight' RGB LED controller project.

'Interlight' Internet enabled RGB LED Controller. Programmed by Chris Telford christophertelford@yahoo.com.
Based on examples including https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L55QYFnnrgo from Adafruit Industries.

Project Description;

The aim of the project is to control a 10W RGB LED using the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi with PWM so that different colours can be mixed together for nice lighting effects. I will make this into a decorative table lamp / mood light / room light. 

The Pi is used to generate the PWM signal (instead of an arduino or 555 timer) so that a website interface can be run to allow anyone on the same internal network to control the light using a computer, laptop or smartphone.

Software used;

Raspbian on the Raspberry Pi model B.             https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

pigpio library on the raspberry pi.               http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/

Flask for the webserver. (main.py).               http://flask.pocoo.org/

Python3 for the LED control software. (light.py)  https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/

HTML & Javascript for the website. (index.html)   https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp

I am not very experienced with any of these languages. If you spot mistakes, that's to be expected. Suggestions are welcome. It works and doesn't give error messages (at the moment).

Hardware Used;

Raspberry Pi Model B (old single core slow one).

A 10W RGB LED chip. These are available for cheap on ebay and elsewhere. 

I used an old CPU heatsink to keep the LED cool. You cannot run high power LEDs without a good heatsink attached or they will burn up within seconds at full power. Any old CPU heatsink should cool a 10W LED without needing a fan.

I am using 3 individual constant current LED driver boards to power the RGB LED. Search google or ebay for '3W LED Driver 700mA PWM dimming input 5-35V DC-DC constant current module' or similar. These take a PWM signal in which can be generated by the GPIO pins on the raspberry pi. Each one is rated to drive one of the channels on a 10W RGB LED (but check specs before wiring up to make sure). Other LED drivers with PWM inputs are available that will work with higher power RGB LEDs so feel free to experiment.

I have put 10k resistors and diodes on the PWM input from the raspberry pi to the LED drivers to help protect the pi's pins.

I have used a 'mini 360 DC to DC step down buck converter module' switching power supply and hacked USB cable to provide the raspberry pi with 5V from the same battery as the LED control circuitry. This is not necessary if you just want to use a raspberry pi power supply or phone charger but is a good idea if you want to close the raspberry pi away in a box to make a table lamp with a single power input.

You could use a cheap and simple low power through hole RGB LED and some resistors wired directly to the raspberry pi's GPIO pins if you wanted to play with the software before spending more money on LED hardware.

Please feel free to ask questions or make comments if you have any. 

Future Possibilities

Using different LED driver boards and more powerful RGB LED chips could make the project more interesting.

I used an original raspberry pi model B because i had one in a drawer. If doing the project from scratch I would use a raspberry pi zero W because they are physically much smaller and have better connectivity (built in wifi). https://www.modmypi.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-zero-board-379/rpi-zero-board/raspberry-pi-zero-wireless/
